# Psychic-Game
Project is called "The Psychic-Game"

The idea of the game is that it prints out each letter that has been guessed by the user while 
simultaneoulsy counting down how many guesses are left. If the user chooses the correct letter Wins will go up by one. If the user chooses incorrectly losses will go up by one.
